                    <p>
                        I&apos;m Luis Henrique Abrantes, a high school senior
                        enrolled in an integrated technical program at the
                        Federal Institute of SÃ£o Paulo (IFSP). With a passion
                        for innovation and programming, I focus on creating
                        scalable and efficient full-stack applications using
                        React, Node.js, and Python. As the Founder and CEO of
                        TutorTime, I&apos;ve led the development of an
                        innovative platform that connects students with peer
                        tutors and teachers, revolutionizing how academic
                        support is organized in educational institutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TutorTime represents my vision for making education more
                        accessible and efficiently managed. Under my leadership,
                        the platform has evolved from a concept to a
                        comprehensive solution built with Supabase, React, and
                        Vite. I oversee all aspects of development while
                        maintaining the strategic direction, transforming
                        TutorTime from a project into a potential startup
                        venture with real-world applications for schools and
                        universities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Driven by curiosity and a commitment to excellence, I
                        approach new challenges with creativity and
                        determination. My journey includes hackathons like
                        PennApps XXV at the University of Pennsylvania, where I
                        participated after successfully organizing a
                        crowdfunding campaign to finance my first international
                        trip. As President of the Coding Club and ARINTER
                        Ambassador, I&apos;ve built leadership and
                        organizational abilities while collaborating with a
                        diverse tech community. My certifications in Artificial
                        Intelligence, Linux Network Administration, and Database
                        Management demonstrate my drive for continuous learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My expertise ranges from frontend development to backend
                        logic and database design. I&apos;ve explored astronomy
                        through Space INPE, blending curiosity for the cosmos
                        with the power of code. Beyond building software,
                        I&apos;m passionate about exploring new cultures,
                        brainstorming with fellow hackers, and pushing the
                        boundaries of technology to create transformative
                        solutions. I believe in leveraging programming to
                        inspire others and bring innovative ideas to life.
